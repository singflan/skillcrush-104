			<h4>Time is on your side</h4>
			<p>In life, and especially in modern-day living, we have developed the expectation that everything needs to happen quickly. If the food isn't done in 5 minutes it's too long. If traffic is bad than the day is ending horribly. We need to learn how to ski, program or do anything quickly and if not, then it's not the best choice and we move on, never accomplishing anything of value or importance.</p>
			<p>Hard things take time. If we view time as an ally and set aside time each day an activity, our minds adapt and pick up the new skill. But it requires consistency or daily discipline. But if we have a goal and choose what to do each day, we will eventually reach the goal. And instead of stressing at the slowness of our progress, we rejoice that we are moving and arriving each day a little bit closer to our desired destination. That's the key to progress and ending up where we want to be.</p>
			
			<h4>Don't skip steps!</h4>
			
			<p>Do you remember playing video games and being tempted to use the cheats or the books to find ways to beat the game? Did you enjoy most the games that you solved the problems on your own or that you got help on? What was your favorite video game and why? Was it beating the game or playing it that brought you the most enjoyment?</p>

			<p>You see, the key is to enjoy the journey and the path of real learning, because the destination brings satisfaction, but only if the journey required some time and effort and brought some surprises along the way. Coding is the same. It takes time to do it effectively. If we focus on the present and on the journey, we will be happy when we get a job and then be in position to attempt to have more complicated or difficult jobs or projects. </p>
			
			<p>The journey is worth the time and price.</p>
